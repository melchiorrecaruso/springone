# SpringONE

Here is my program for the calculation of cylindrical helical compression springs, 
freely inspired by FED+ from Hexagon software, and based on the reference standard EN 13906-1.

If you want to report a bug or request a new feature, please report it in the issues, 
and I will be happy to implement it.
